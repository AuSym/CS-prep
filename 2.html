    <br>
  <p> <b>11.4.1.1 describe relational databases and their purpose</b></p><br>
    <p>A relational database organizes data into structured tables with columns and rows. Each table represents an entity, and the relationships between tables allow for efficient data storage, management, and retrieval. Relational databases help maintain data integrity and prevent redundancy.</p>
<br><br>
    <p><b>11.4.1.2 use the terms attribute, object, index, record, table and tuple to describe databases</b></p><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Attribute:</b> A characteristic or property of an entity, represented as a column in a table.</li>
      <li><b>Object:</b> The subject or entity described by the data (e.g., a "Customer" table represents customer data).</li>
      <li><b>Index:</b> A data structure that improves search speed and retrieval efficiency.</li>
      <li><b>Record:</b> A single, unique row within a table representing one instance of an entity.</li>
      <li><b>Table:</b> A collection of records related to a specific entity, with columns and rows.</li>
      <li><b>Tuple:</b> Another term for a row or record in a table.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <p><b>11.4.1.3 explain the difference between primary composite and foreign key</b></p><br>
    <p><b>Primary Key:</b> A unique identifier for each record in a table.<br>
    <b>Composite Key:</b> A key made up of two or more attributes that uniquely identify a record.<br>
    <b>Foreign Key:</b> An attribute in one table that references the primary key of another table, establishing a link between the two tables.</p>
<br>
    <p><b>11.4.1.4 define data types when creating a database </b></p><br>

    <div class="content">
  <br> <b><p>11.4.1.7 bring connections to the third normal form (3NF)</p> </b><br>
<br><b><p>Third Normal Form (3NF)</b> is a database normalization rule that aims to eliminate data redundancy and dependency issues. A table is in 3NF if:
    <ul>
      <li>It is in Second Normal Form (2NF).</li>
      <li>It has no transitive dependencies, meaning non-key attributes are not dependent on other non-key attributes.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Benefits of 3NF include improved data integrity, reduced duplication, and optimized storage. This normalization process organizes data more efficiently by breaking down larger tables into smaller, more focused tables connected by keys.</p>
 
 <br> <b><p>11.4.1.5 define the connections between tables in database</p> </b><br>
        <p>In a relational database, connections between tables allow data to be linked and accessed efficiently. Common relationships include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>One-to-One:</b> Each record in Table A relates to exactly one record in Table B, and vice versa.<img src="images/onetoone.PNG" alt="Entity Symbol" width="200px"></li>
      <li><b>One-to-Many:</b> A single record in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B.<img src="images/onetomany.PNG" alt="Entity Symbol" width="200px"></li>
      <li><b>Many-to-Many:</b> Records in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B and vice versa, typically implemented using a junction table.<img src="images/manytomany.PNG" alt="Entity Symbol"  width="200px"></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Foreign keys are used to establish these relationships, linking the primary key of one table to a corresponding column in another table, which maintains referential integrity and allows related data to be efficiently retrieved and manipulated.</p>
 
       <br> <b><p>11.4.1.6 create an entity-relationship (ER) model </p> </b><br> 
         <p>An Entity-Relationship (ER) Model visually represents database structure and the relationships between entities (tables). ER models consist of symbols to depict entities, attributes, and relationships.</p>

  <br> <b><p>11.4.2.1 explain the purpose of data dictionary </p> </b><br> 
         <p>A data dictionary is a centralized repository that stores metadata about database elements, providing detailed information about each attribute and table in a database. It includes descriptions of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Table Names:</b> Names of tables within the database.</li>
      <li><b>Column Names:</b> Attributes or fields in each table.</li>
      <li><b>Data Types:</b> The type of data stored in each attribute (e.g., integer, text).</li>
      <li><b>Constraints:</b> Any rules applied to the data (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE).</li>
      <li><b>Relationships:</b> Connections between tables, defined by foreign keys and other links.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Data dictionaries are essential for database management as they provide a reference for developers and administrators, helping ensure data integrity, consistency, and clarity. They also facilitate communication across teams by offering a single source of truth for database structure and standards.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>CREATE:</b> Used to create new tables or databases, defining the structure and columns. 
        <pre><code>CREATE TABLE Students (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50), Age INT);</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>ALTER:</b> Modifies an existing table by adding, modifying, or deleting columns.
        <pre><code>ALTER TABLE Students ADD COLUMN Grade CHAR(1);</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>DROP:</b> Deletes tables or databases, including all their data and structure.
        <pre><code>DROP TABLE Students;</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br> <b><p>11.4.2.4 describe the basic SQL queries for working with one table in a database: SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE  </p> </b><br> 
     <p>These SQL commands are part of DML and are essential for working with data within a single table:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>SELECT:</b> Retrieves data from one or more columns within a table.
        <pre><code>SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Age > 18;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>INSERT:</b> Adds new records to a table.
        <pre><code>INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20);</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>UPDATE:</b> Modifies existing records in a table.
        <pre><code>UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE Name = 'Alice';</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>DELETE:</b> Removes records from a table based on a condition.
        <pre><code>DELETE FROM Students WHERE Age = 18; </code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br> <b><p>11.4.2.5 use SQL SELECT for data selection in more tables </p> </b><br> 
     <p>When data needs to be retrieved from multiple tables, SQL JOIN operations are used. Common joins include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>INNER JOIN:</b> Retrieves only matching records between tables.
        <pre><code>SELECT Students.Name, Grades.Score 
FROM Students 
INNER JOIN Grades ON Students.ID = Grades.StudentID;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>LEFT JOIN:</b> Retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right table, with NULLs if no match is found.
        <pre><code>SELECT Students.Name, Grades.Score 
FROM Students 
LEFT JOIN Grades ON Students.ID = Grades.StudentID;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>RIGHT JOIN:</b> Retrieves all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
        <pre><code>SELECT Students.Name, Grades.Score 
FROM Students 
RIGHT JOIN Grades ON Students.ID = Grades.StudentID;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>FULL JOIN:</b> Retrieves all records when there is a match in either table.
        <pre><code>SELECT Students.Name, Grades.Score 
FROM Students 
FULL JOIN Grades ON Students.ID = Grades.StudentID;</code></pre>

<div class="content">
    
    <p><b>11.2.2.4 discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using prototypes when developing solutions</b> </p>
     <p>Prototyping involves creating an early model or sample of a system to evaluate its features, usability, and functionality. Here are some key advantages and disadvantages:</p>
    <h3>Advantages of Prototyping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Improved User Feedback:</b> Allows users to interact with a model of the system early on, leading to valuable feedback that can guide development.</li>
      <li><b>Enhanced Communication:</b> Visual prototypes provide a clear understanding between developers and stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings.</li>
      <li><b>Early Error Detection:</b> Identifying usability issues or design flaws in the prototype phase helps avoid costly changes later.</li>
      <li><b>Flexibility in Design:</b> Allows developers to make adjustments based on iterative feedback, enhancing the final product’s functionality and user satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Disadvantages of Prototyping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Scope Creep:</b> As users request new features, the scope may expand beyond the initial project plan, potentially causing delays.</li>
      <li><b>Misinterpretation of Prototype:</b> Users may mistakenly view the prototype as the final product, creating unrealistic expectations for project completion.</li>
      <li><b>High Cost and Time Investment:</b> Creating a detailed prototype can require additional time and resources, especially if numerous iterations are needed.</li>
      <li><b>Potential Inefficiency:</b> Developers may focus on refining the prototype rather than concentrating on the complete system, which can delay actual development.</li>
    </ul>
    
     <p><b>11.2.2.5 discuss the use of prototypes based on a specific example<br>11.2.2.6 develop a prototype for a new system </b> </p>
     <p>Consider a company developing a new mobile banking application. Here’s how prototypes help in this context:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Initial Wireframe:</b> A simple wireframe of the application screens is created to showcase the navigation and layout.</li>
      <li><b>Feedback Gathering:</b> Users interact with the wireframe, offering feedback on elements like ease of navigation and screen transitions.</li>
      <li><b>Interactive Prototype:</b> An interactive version of the prototype is created with functional buttons and mock data, allowing users to experience a closer version of the final app.</li>
      <li><b>Refinement:</b> Based on feedback, developers modify layouts, colors, and features, gradually bringing the app closer to the end product that meets user needs.</li>

    <p><b>11.2.2.3 describe the characteristics of a development framework<br></b></p> 
     <p>A development framework provides the structure and tools necessary for developing software. GCSE tasks might ask, "Explain the role of a development framework in software projects."</p>
    <h3>Key Characteristics of Development Frameworks:</h3>
    <p>Development frameworks include libraries, tools, and best practices that simplify and standardize coding.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Modularity:</b> Frameworks support modular design, where code is organized in reusable components, aiding collaboration and consistency.</li>
      <li><b>Code Libraries:</b> Provide ready-to-use code modules, speeding up development for common features (e.g., login systems).</li>
      <li><b>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Support:</b> Often integrated with popular IDEs, frameworks improve developer productivity through tools for debugging, testing, and code completion.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples of Development Frameworks:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>React (JavaScript):</b> Used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).</li>
      <li><b>Spring (Java):</b> Commonly used for enterprise-level backend applications.</li>
      <li><b>Django (Python):</b> Popular for web applications due to its simplicity and quick development cycle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>11.2.2.7 define minimum requirements for hardware when implementing<br></b></p> 
     <h3>Minimum Hardware Requirements:</h3>
    <p>When implementing a new system, it’s essential to ensure the hardware meets the minimum requirements to support the software efficiently. Typical hardware considerations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Processor:</b> A multi-core processor is recommended for handling complex tasks smoothly.</li>
      <li><b>Memory (RAM):</b> Adequate memory is essential to support multitasking and resource-demanding applications; generally, 8GB or more is suggested.</li>
      <li><b>Storage:</b> Solid State Drives (SSD) provide faster access to data compared to traditional HDDs, and at least 256GB is commonly required for system responsiveness.</li>
      <li><b>Graphics Card:</b> For systems handling graphic-intensive tasks, a dedicated graphics card is necessary to ensure high-quality visual output and processing power.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>11.3.1.5 justify their choice of applied software and choice criteria based on the goals  <br></b></p> 
       <p>Example  question: "Your school needs software to create presentations and manage documents. Justify your choice of software based on the goals."</p>
    <h3>Criteria for Choosing Applied Software:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Compatibility:</b> The software should work seamlessly with existing systems and file formats (e.g., Microsoft Office for document and presentation needs).</li>
      <li><b>User-Friendliness:</b> Software should be easy for all users to operate without extensive training (e.g., Google Docs for collaborative editing).</li>
      <li><b>Cost-Efficiency:</b> Budget considerations are essential; schools may opt for open-source or cost-effective solutions (e.g., LibreOffice as a free alternative).</li>
      <li><b>Security and Privacy:</b> The software must protect sensitive data, especially in educational environments (e.g., cloud-based software with data encryption).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this example, schools may choose Microsoft Office for its widespread use, compatibility, and rich features, justifying it as a reliable option for both educators and students.</p>
